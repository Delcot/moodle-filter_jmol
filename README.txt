This is a very simple filter taking advantage of the excellent open-source 
"Jmol" molecular visualisation project (http://jmol.sourceforge.net). The filter includes some some basic controls and a help file.

TO INSTALL:

1. Copy the /jmol folder (and all the files inside) located in the /filter folder, to the /filter folder of your Moodle web server.

2. Copy the /jmol folder, containing jmol.html, located in /lang/en/help, to the /lang/en/help folder of your Moodle web server.


3. Remember to activate the filter in Moodle's filter admin screen.

I have included a sample file, "manywater.pdb" which could be used for test
purposes. Simply add a link to ........./moodle/filter/jmol/manywater.pdb 
into your course to try it out.
