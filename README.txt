This is a very simple filter taking advantage of the excellent open-source 
"Jmol" molecular visualisation project (http://jmol.sourceforge.net). The filter includes some some basic controls and a help file.

TO INSTALL:

1. Unpack the .zip or .tar.gz download.
2. Rename the unpacked file jmol. 
It should contain directly contain a jmolappet and lang folder/directory and additional files including filter.php
3. Copythis jmol folder (and all its contents) to the inside of the /filter folder of your Moodle 2.0.x installation i.e. alongside the folders for other filters
Remember to activate the filter in Moodle's filter admin screen. 
Depending on settings, you may need to activate this filter in individual Moodle courses.

I have included a sample file, "manywater.pdb" which could be used for test
purposes. Simply add a link to ........./moodle/filter/jmol/manywater.pdb 
into your course to try it out.
